# Bitbanging UDP packets over 10baseT Ethernet on an FPGA

I copied the verilog from [fpgaforfun](https://www.fpga4fun.com/10BASE-T1.html).
Still took a few days to get working. I went down a wrong path with trying to 
use differential signals on the board. 
And the "uplink" switch on the hub needs to be depressed for packets to get forwarded.

Only 2 pins (pin 1 TX+, pin 2 TX-) from the ethernet cable are used, as seen in the
breakout board.

Glad I saved this ancient 10 Mbit router with fancy activity lights.
On the target host, about 10Mbps of traffic is successfully received.
