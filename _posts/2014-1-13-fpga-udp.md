# Bitbanging UDP packets over 10baseT Ethernet on an FPGA

I copied the verilog from [fpgaforfun](https://www.fpga4fun.com/10BASE-T1.html).
Of course it didn't work right away. Partly I went down a wrong path with trying to 
use differential signals on the board. It also turns out the "uplink" switch on the 
hub needs to be depressed, and I might have had a bad connection connecting directly
from an ethernet cable which got solved by using the breakout board.

This old 10 Mbit router that I saved like a packrat came in handy with
its utilization lights.
On the target host, a python program receives the packets and shows that
about 10Mbps of traffic is coming across.
