# Bitbanging UDP packets over 10baseT Ethernet on an FPGA

I copied the verilog from [fpgaforfun](https://www.fpga4fun.com/10BASE-T1.html).
Of course it didn't work right away. Partly I went down a wrong path with trying to 
use differential signals on the board. It also turns out the "uplink" switch on the 
hub needs to be depressed, and I might have had a bad connection connecting directly
from an ethernet cable which got solved by using the breakout board.

This old 10 Mbit hub came in handy with its utilization lights. 
On the target host, a python program receives the packets and shows that
about 10Mbps of traffic is coming across.

minimalist box was on sale last month for $120. I picked it up without much thought for
a trip and wasn't expecting much, but it ran both Vivado and Quartus fine 
(free versions seem performance throttled anyway), along with wsl so that I could 
largely ignore that it was Windows. 
And the USB port worked properly with Arduino (it was a pain on the mac.)

I became curious what higher performing systems might be available and found this huge
[comparison sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IjCpi4_z_WfO0G53E_mWNv0qV3mLOh0ZgUNdmHmmgc8/edit#gid=239063037). 
Unfortunately it lacks performance data.
